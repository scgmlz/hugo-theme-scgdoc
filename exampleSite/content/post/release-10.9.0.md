This release includes a new formalism for polarized neutron scattering, where the materials are defined by their magnetization instead of a homogeneous B-field.
The loading and saving of project files in the GUI has also been improved in terms of responsiveness and performance.

**API changes:**

None

1. Magnetic scattering: New formalism that uses the magnetization of the different materials instead of the B-field
